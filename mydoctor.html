                    <p class="big"><span style="color: #895A83; font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span></p>

                    <p class="pMyStory">Our team decided to create an app that would help people be able to find a rated
                        doctor and book an appointment with that doctor. This will help users meet thier specific health
                        needs in one organized location. As UX Designers, we planned on conducting an interview plan and
                        using the data we collect to create a final digital prototype that is user friendly.

                    </p>
                    <p class="big"><span style="color: #895A83; font-weight: bold;">User Research</span></p>

                    <p class="pMyStory"> Over the next three weeks our team conducted 3-5 interviews in order to
                        define our user and the problem at hand. We worked together to lay out our findings and list
                        needs to which our product will meet. Once we had a good indication of specific features, we
                        began to build our prototype. From the data we gathered, we were able to organize it into our
                        affinity diagarm and empathy map. This information helped us conclude our research with the
                        creation of our user persona.

                    </p>

                    <p class="big"><span style="color: #895A83; font-weight: bold;">Definition & Ideation</span>
                    </p>

                    <p class="pMyStory"> Our problem statment concludes as...MyDoctor was designed to achieve a
                        simplified way for patients to find the correct medical specialist for their needs.
                        We have observed that users struggle to confidently select a healthcare provider while sorting
                        through a myriad of options. How might MyDoctor streamline the search for healthcare so that
                        customers are satisfied with
                        their selection? We created a value proposition of "The intuitive way to find
                        the specialized care you need."


                    </p>
                    <p class="big"><span style="color: #895A83; font-weight: bold;">Prototyping</span></p>

                    <p class="pMyStory"> We completed a competitor anaylsis with other similar apps to MyDoctor such as
                        "ZOCDOC" and "WEBMD". This information helped us form the beginning stages of designing our app
                        with some early sketches. Once the sketches were complete, we did another several user tests to
                        test out the over design. There were many iterations that we went forward with changing from the
                        user
                        tests.
                    </p>
                    <p class="big"><span style="color: #895A83; font-weight: bold;">Testing & Iterating</span></p>

                    <p class="pMyStory"> Now that our changes were completed on our sketches, we went forward with
                        creating the iOS mockups and final prototype on Figma.
                    </p>
                    <p class="big"><span style="color: #895A83; font-weight: bold;">Final Thoughts</span></p>

                    <p class="pMyStory"> Our team really enjoyed working on this project together and watching it
                        unfold. Our idea began as a doctor app that was able to find people a specific doctor in their
                        native language. That grew into providing many filter options such as insurance, male/female
                        doctor, picture, bio, and more, so that our users could narrow down their search easily to find
                        their perfect doctor.

                        It was amazing how much faster our team could get the research, interviews, and project
                        completed when working on it together. It was also insightful to be able to share ideas with
                        each other and brainstorm when problem solving.

                        If we were to launch this app,, we would want to improve it by creating a booking function. This
                        would allow our users to go one step further past saving their prefered doctor by being able to
                        book a
                        time and day to meet with the doctor all through the MyDoctor app. It would save a huge step
                        or our users and be faster than calling a doctors office to try and schedule an appointment.

                        Our team is happy with the result of our app and we were grateful to have had each other
                        to help build our UX design skills.
